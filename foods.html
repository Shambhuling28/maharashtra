            <h1>Vada Pav</h1>
            <p>
                Vada Pav can easily be called the Indian version of a burger! A delicious, spicy, deep-fried patty made of potato is squeezed between a thick slice of bread, similar to a burger bun. Between the vada (patty) and pav (bread) a spicy mix of spices and salt is sprinkled and garnished with a fried, salted green chilli. Sounds perfect, isn't it? It's an all-day snack and is extremely popular among Maharashtrians. It is very economical, filling and easily accessible. Another popular offshoot is the Bhajiya Pav, which has batter-fried onions instead of the patty.</p>

            <h1> Sabudana Khichdi</h1>
            <p>
                Sabudana Khichdi is a traditional Maharashtrian dish made from soaked sabudana pearls sautéed with peanuts and potatoes and flavoured with cumin seeds, green chillies, and curry leaves. This dish is popular during fasting periods due to its high carbohydrate content, providing a quick and light energy source. The unique texture of soaked sabudana pearls, the crunch of peanuts, and the spiciness of green chillies offer a delightful culinary experience.<br><br>

Sabudana Khichdi is not only comfort food but also a flavourful treat for your taste buds. It is commonly enjoyed across Maharashtra for its simplicity and satisfying flavours.

              Puran Poli, a traditional Maharashtrian sweet flatbread, is a delightful treat for festive occasions and special celebrations.

The richness of ghee enhances its flavours, making it a favourite among those with a sweet tooth.<br><br>

Puran Poli is a labour of love, requiring skill to achieve the perfect balance of sweetness and texture. It is commonly paired with a dollop of ghee or served with a generous helping of lentil curry.

            <p>
               Street food is a huge part of Maharashtra's cuisine, and Bhelpuri is amongst the top choices. The snack blends puffed rice, veggies, and tamarind sauce for a tangy flavour explosion. A local favourite turned nationwide sensation; Bhelpuri is a texture and flavour party with crunchy puffed rice, soft veggies, and sweet, sour, and spicy chutneys. Topped with sev, cilantro, and a hint of lime, it's a guilt-free, anytime snack that hits all the right notes. Maharashtra's culinary magic strikes again, turning a simple mix into a symphony of taste and crunch.

</h1>
            <p>
              Basundi, a sweet treat from Maharashtra, is like a milk miracle. It is boiled until it's creamy and rich, then sprinkled with cardamom or saffron for extra oomph. Then, slivered almonds and pistachios join the party on top. It's a dessert superstar, especially during celebrations. It is even mixed with other fruits and sweets, for instance, custard apple Basundi or angoor Basundi (with mini rasgullas). Maharashtra sure knows how to turn simple milk into a dessert masterpiece!  </p>
