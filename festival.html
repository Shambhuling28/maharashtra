            <h1>Makar Sankranti</h1>
            <p>
                Makar Sankranti is one of the most widely celebrated harvest festivals of India. Also known as Pongal, Uttarayana, Lohri, Khichdi, Shishur Saenkraat, and Maagh Bihu, it is celebrated in different parts with different names. It marks a new beginning as the sun moves into the Capricorn zodiac. People take a holy dip in the Ganga, praying for blessings and prosperity. In Gujarat, kite flying competitions create a vibrant atmosphere, enjoyed by all age groups. One of the biggest attractions during this festival is the Kumbh Mela, held at the confluence of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers.

            <h1>Holi</h1>
            <p>
                The festival of colors is everyone’s favourite whether you celebrate it as a harvest festival or not. Holi is one of the prestigious harvest festivals of India known for colors and water. Also famously known as Phagwah, Holi signifies bidding adieu to winter and welcoming the springs with great gusto with the hope of the new season bringing in positivity and good harvests for one and all. It is celebrated with multi-hued colours that are smeared by one across the faces of friends and family and savouring hot jalebis, bhajjis and cold milk based thandais. The religious purpose of Holi is Holika Dahan as well as Rangapanchami which is celebrated the next day. Some parts of India such as the Braj region is very famous for the Lathmar Holi and is visited by a lot of tourists every year.

            <h1>Pola</h1>
            <p>
               Like Lohri in North India, the harvest festival of Pola is celebrated by farmers all over Maharashtra. It falls on Pithori Amavasya, the new moon day of the holy month of Shravan. On this day bullocks, which are an integral part of the agriculture – basically the backbone of it – are worshiped.<br><br>
They are bathed, decorated with ornaments and taken out in processions across the village, accompanied by music and dancing. The procession of the bulls marks the social standing of the farmers – the order in which they are taken out into the village.

            <h1>Ganesh Chathurthi - Most Famous Festival of Maharashtra</h1>
            <p>
               Lord Ganesha, the deity of wisdom, is the most loved in Maharashtra and Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated with the most grandeur. In August, preparations for the auspicious day when Lord Ganesh was born – begin with great enthusiasm. It is an 11-day festival, beginning with the installation of beautifully sculpted Ganesh idols in homes and large pandals, colorfully decorated, depicting religious and cultural themes.<br><br>
The Ganesh idols are worshiped and many cultural events are organised. People throng the huge pandals to catch a glimpse of their favorite God. Visits to friends and family to offer prayers and join the celebrations, and partake some delicious food are looked forward to by all. It is also a great chance to gorge on modaks (steamed rice-flour dumplings with a succulent coconut and ghee filling), since they are considered to be the Lord’s favorite food. On the 11th day comes the time to bid farewell to Ganesha. People take the idols in procession with an accompaniment of music and dance for immersion in the sea or nearby river or lake.

            <h1 > Ashadhi Ekadashi</h1>
            <p>
              Celebrated in honour of the great Hindu god Vishnu, Ashadhi Ekadashi is the culmination of the great Pandharpur chi Vari (Journey to Pandharpur). Pandharpur is a town in Maharashtra on the banks of the river Chandrabhaga and is considered to be the abode of Vitthal, a local form of the mighty God. Almost a month in advance, millions of people begin a pilgrimage to visit the holy city on foot. It is a sight to behold as millions and millions of people throng this tiny city, driven only by their faith in the Lord. These people known as the Warkaris (people who have undertaken this journey) chant holy songs and live in extremely minimalist conditions during the entire journey, and the atmosphere is of great devotion and mutual support as everyone’s ultimate aim is only to reach the Lord and fall at his feet.<br><br>
All over the state, people observe a fast and partake only simple food, which is a reminder of the journey that the Warkaris undertake, and also a sign of devotion and faith in their Vithu Mauli (The Lord).
